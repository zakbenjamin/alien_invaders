Reverse engineered original space invaders game from cykod.


Pac-Man has had a complete reboot and meets space invaders. 
He must defend himself from Blinky, Inky and Pinky who flock from above in order to try and defeat Pac-Man once again. 

In this game you must defeat all 3 levels of Pac-Mans enemies whilst trying to get the best score. Try and hit the boss alien that runs along the top - be sure not to miss him. Boss alien = more points! 


Use spacebar to fire and left and right to move.
